STATUS: On hold

Swarthmore Information Technology Services (ITS) does not want 
a third-party site collecting credentials, and effectively shut
this project down. Instead, Joel Cooper, the CITO, is working
towards incorporating a GPA calculator in the main mySwat website.

TODO:
- Acquire SSL from SCCS webmasters (Daniel Elias, Noah?)
- Adjust getSource.py to take credentials as argument
- Santize submitCredentials.php post input
- Change script in submitCredentials.php to gpaCalc.py
- Add shadowgrade and major options in gpacalc.py
